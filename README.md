# JungleGame

Openclassrooms javascript game
Start by randomly generating the game map. Each box can be either:

Empty

Unavailable (dimmed)

On the map, a limited number of weapons (up to 4) will be placed randomly and can be collected by players who pass through.

You should invent at least 4 types of weapons in the game, each with different damage inflicted (don't worry though, your choice of weapons doesn't need to be violent or come from the classic lineup of weapons. If you count a cupcake as a weapon, that's cool too)! The default weapon which team players must inflict 10 points of damage. Each weapon has a name and associated visual.

The placement of the two players is also randomly on the map when the game loads. They should not touch (they can not be together).
